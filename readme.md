## KMeans

C++ method provided as well. Originally the author hope to enhance the efficiency of runing the code, but it's too hard to finish the make files to suit the python enviroment, so the c plus plus versino is always used as local test classes, and the python versions are used for handing the assigments.

In `KMeans.ipynb` shows the implementation of KMeans++. The original KMeans method has limitations, and was shwon in `cpp/PY_KMEANS.h`.



## Soft KMeans

C++ method provided as well, only for faster test.





## PCA

C++ method provided as well, only for faster test.
